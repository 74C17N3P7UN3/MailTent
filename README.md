## 🧐 About

I started working on this project as a school's assignment but soon got addicted to it.\
I found it really interesting how you could interact with server files using php and gradually started putting a lot of efforts into shipping a nice-looking interface too.\
After a month of progress though, I started losing motivation and dropped the project to focus on other stuff.\
If you want to check out the result, see the [🏁️ Getting Started](#-getting-started) section.

Keep in mind that this is still in development and that Altervista has some [🚨️ Known Bugs](#-known-bugs).

I'll get to it as soon as I rediscover this project as I now moved on to React projects.

#### 🐞 Known Bugs

- Altervista has some problems with syncing the database, in my local environment (and possibly other hosting websites) is working fine. I won't finx this as I moved on from PHP to newer technologies.
